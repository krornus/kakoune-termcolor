# kakoune-termcolor
Kakoune support for ANSI terminal colors inside buffers

Adds syntax highlighting for most ANSI codes (`filetype=tc`).
Also adds the command `hide-colorcodes` (automatically called on filetype=tc) which will
hide ANSI colorcodes from view inside the buffer (no actual modification is performed)
